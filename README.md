# C++ Operators and Their Usage

## Aim
To study and implement various operators in C++, including bitwise, assignment, miscellaneous operators, and understand operator precedence.

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators perform operations on the binary representation of integers.

| Operator | Description                                                             | 
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `&`      | AND: Copies bit if it exists in both operands                          | 
| '|'     | OR: Copies bit if it exists in either operand                          | 
| `^`      | XOR: Copies bit if it exists in one operand but not both               | 
| `~`      | One's Complement: Flips all bits (unary operator)                      | 
| `<<`     | Left Shift: Shifts bits to the left                                    | 
| `>>`     | Right Shift: Shifts bits to the right                                  | 

## Conclusion 

In this experiment, we examined and applied bitwise operators in C++. We also studied the rules of operator precedence to understand how expressions are evaluated. This experiment helped strengthen our understanding of operator functionality, enabling us to write more accurate and efficient code by correctly applying operator rules and hierarchies in real-world programming scenarios.
